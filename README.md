# Violin-body-impulse-response-audio-examples
This repository contains audio demonstrations of a simulated violin body IR that was created for my master thesis at Fachgebiet Audiokommunikation at TU Berlin. 

It contains on recorded section of a bowed string model by Ricardo Russo (https://github.com/Rickr922/Faust-FDS/blob/master/library/BowedString.dsp).

This signal was convolved with a simulated IR that was created with a finite element method simulation.

Additionally the bowed string signal was convolved with 3 measured example violin IR for comparison. (http://pcfarina.eng.unipr.it/)
